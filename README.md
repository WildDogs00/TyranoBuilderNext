# About the modification
The modification for TyranoBuilder is based on the VN Effector theme. It adds new features and improves existing ones.
The idea for the modification came up when it became clear that the author of TyranoBuilder had stopped developing his application.
It's been a long time since I started working on improving TyranoBuilder. During this time, the main features of the app have been significantly improved, as well as new features that will help you create games more efficiently.

# Improvements
Now I will tell you about some of the improvements that were implemented during the development process.

Interface:

The new interface pleases the eye with pleasant colors. It has two main modes: light and dark.
Overall, the interface has been significantly improved, and now it looks nice and more understandable.

Interface language:

Now it is very easy to switch languages, and with the new update, many other languages have been added to the existing Russian and English languages, such as Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and others.

Creating a project:

I removed unnecessary tabs that did not carry any useful information, and put all the data on one screen. This allowed us to speed up and simplify the project creation process.

Editor Settings:

Now you can choose the size of the editor. Supported resolutions are 1280x720 and 1700x900. This is convenient for those who have a small or large monitor.
You can also configure the components. Now you can arrange them in one or two columns.
Autosave project features were added after 5, 10, and 15 minutes. In addition, you can choose the starting scene of the game.
In general, these improvements make the development process more comfortable.

Translating a game:

In the original version of TyranoBuilder, creating a game translation required creating different builds of the game with different translations, using a system of conditional statements (if-else) to select between languages, or creating duplicate scenes for different translations. 
Now, all this is not necessary, because there is a translation system that translates not only text in the game, but also images. In general, it is now very easy to translate for the game, and the list of languages supported for translation is very extensive.

Variable Update:

Updating variables is a process that allows you to change the values displayed on the screen in real time. In TyranoBuilder, you need to recreate the component responsible for displaying the variable in order to update its value. 
Using a special component that can be simply placed on the stage, updates are instantaneous. This means that you don't need to perform any additional actions-the system will do everything itself.
This is just a short list of new features that will make your work on the game more comfortable. In fact, the functionality is much broader: for example, we have a timer transition, a progress bar, a new chat, inventory, and much more.

# Installation
The installation is quite simple, what you downloaded is an archive, and this archive just needs to be unpacked to the root folder of TyranoBuilder, which is located approximately along this path C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\TyranoBuilder.
